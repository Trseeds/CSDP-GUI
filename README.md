This is the GUI version of CSharp Disc Player.

Current Features:
	-Plays CDs!
	-Play, pause, stop, next, and previous functions.
	-Seekbar
	-Eject button
	-Hotkeys (CTRL-Q, CTRL-SHIFT-E, Media buttons)
Upcoming Features:
	-Multi-threading; The GUI waits on the CD drive, and stalls quite often, especially with slower drives.
	-Better Seekbar; The Seekbar is currently implemented using the Windows Forms Trackbar, which is lackluster.
	-CDDB; Some form of CDDB will be added, most likely GNUDB.
	-Customizable hotkeys.
